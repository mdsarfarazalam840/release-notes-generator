## Release Notes v1.9.0 - Easier Setup and Enhanced Reliability

We're pleased to announce the release of v1.9.0! This update is focused on making your experience smoother from the very first interaction and improving the stability of your connections.

### Highlights
*   **Smoother Onboarding:** The project is now easier to set up thanks to a clearer and more detailed `README.md` file.
*   **Stronger Connection:** Core communication functions have been updated to use the `OpenRouter` service, which should result in more reliable interactions with external services.
*   **A Look at the Future:** This update is a stepping stone towards an even better product. In this version, we have added all necessary files to bring exciting new capabilities in future releases.

### Improvements
